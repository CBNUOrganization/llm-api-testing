# Project Setup

To set up the project, you need to rename the `.env-sample` file to `.env` in both the `openai` and `claude` folders. Follow the steps below:

## Steps

1. Navigate to the `openai` folder:
    ```sh
    cd /home/sokheang/Research/llm/openai
    ```

2. Rename the `.env-sample` file to `.env`:
    ```sh
    mv .env-sample .env
    ```

3. Navigate to the `claude` folder:
    ```sh
    cd /home/sokheang/Research/llm/claude
    ```

4. Rename the `.env-sample` file to `.env`:
    ```sh
    mv .env-sample .env
    ```

Now, your environment variables should be properly set up for both the `openai` and `claude` folders.
